# ArduinoReadCapacitive
This is a nice demo of the ReadCapacitive function. This is not my invention, but sorry I do not remember / see who to credit.

It was disigned to work best with an Aduino Pro Micro.  On this board the pins will be for nice pins together on one corner of the board.
It can also work well with a full sized Arduino Leonardo.  If you use it with an UNO or MEGA, or Nano, then you will want to remove the Keybard import
and the keyboard commands.  Simple thumb pins, and dupont style hookup wire work very well to create your buttons.

Try adding more buttons and a speaker (plus come code) to get a nice tone organ.  The buttons are completely silent so they won't ruin
your masterful, (chip tunes) musical performance.  :-)

NOTE:  I did not invent this, but I am sorry.  I have been using it for so long, I do not know who to credit.
